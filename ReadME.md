# Approval Engine
This Project is set out to implement a "Dynamic" Approval Flow that can be easily pluged into any other project that requires some form of approval.
It is dynamic as the levels of approvals can be modified and hence does not need to be hard coded

This project implements an Approval flow can satisfy the basic approval flow need for any project.

## Structure
